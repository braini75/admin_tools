The Redmine Admin Tools Plugin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/braini75/admin_tools.svg?branch=master)] (https://travis-ci.org/braini75/admin_tools)
==============================

Collection of little tools one might need sometimes.

I've created this plugin to react of little user or feature requests, without creating new plugins. This is a work on progress, as new features might be included as needed

__Features__:
  * Show all Settings: Create a dump of all Redmine Settings
